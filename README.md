Rate Trasient Analysis (RTA) for Unconventional Oil & Gas Reserviors

* Extracted insights through Exploratory Data Analysis on the Dataset
* Feature Engineered the Dataset by removing linearly correlated features & normalizing the features
* Formulated 2 hypothesis about the data and conducted significance test to evaluate the hypothesis by calculating p-values
* Built Multivariate Linear Regression model to predict the production of unconventional Oil and Gas reserviors
* Evaluated Model Performance, Achieved R^2: 0.94, MAE:  0.03793, MSE:  0.00266 and RMSE:  0.05159
